<p><strong>SOME FAMOUS PSYCHOLOGISTS</strong></p>
<a>
For better or worse a number of psychologists have gained some notoriety over the years, with a few considered outright famous. Here’s a list of significant psychologists and their major contributions to the field.

<br><br>Ivan Pavlov 1849–1936

<strong>Ivan Pavlov</strong><em>was educated in natural sciences in St Petersburg, Russia. He was mostly interested in physiology, and while researching the digestive system in dogs he made his most famous discovery – that dogs salivate before the delivery of food.

Pavlov rang a bell when feeding the dogs and they soon learned to associate the sound with food. After some time the dogs salivated in response to the bell alone. Named Pavlovian or classical conditioning, this discovery has a number of real-life applications including in the treatment of phobias and for aversion therapy.
